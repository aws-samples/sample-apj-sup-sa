title: "Step 7: Multi-Tenant Isolation & User Access"
weight: 50
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this step, you will:
- Enforce tool-level access control with Cedar policies (analysts can't create bookings)
- Switch from the database owner role to an RLS-enforced role for tenant data isolation
- Deploy a Gateway Interceptor that propagates JWT claims to Lambda targets
- Wire JWT claims through to PostgreSQL session variables for row-level security
- Verify that different tenants see only their own data

## The Problem

Your current analytics assistant up to the previous step has two security gaps:

1. **Any user can use any tool.** Analyst Orion Moonshadow can create bookings — but analysts should only read data, not modify it.
2. **Any user can see all tenants' data.** A user at Mythical Unicorns can see Mythic Unicorns' customers and revenue. In a multi-tenant SaaS platform, this is a data breach.

You need two layers of security:
- **Tool-level access control** — which tools each role can use
- **Data-level isolation** — which rows each tenant and role can see

::alert[**SaaS critical:** In a pool model (shared database), a single misconfigured query could expose one tenant's data to another. You need enforcement at the **infrastructure level** — not in the agent's prompt, not in the application code. :link[AgentCore Policy]{href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/policy.html"} handles tool access. :link[PostgreSQL Row-Level Security]{href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html"} handles data isolation. Together, they make multi-tenant security deterministic and auditable.]{type="warning"}

## The Solution

| Layer | Technology | What It Controls | Enforcement Point |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Tool access** | :link[AgentCore Policy (Cedar)]{href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/policy.html"} | Which tools each role can use | Gateway — tool is hidden from unauthorized users |
| **Data isolation** | :link[PostgreSQL RLS]{href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html"} | Which rows each tenant can see | Database engine — impossible to bypass from application |
| **Identity propagation** | :link[Gateway Interceptor]{href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-headers.html"} | Passes JWT from Gateway to Lambda targets | Gateway — forwards Authorization header to targets |

The flow:

```
User logs in → Cognito JWT (custom:role [for role-based access control], custom:account_id [for tenant isolation])
  → Agent passes JWT to Gateway as Bearer token
    → Cedar Policy evaluates: can this role use this tool?
    → Interceptor propagates JWT to Lambda target with header injection
      → Lambda extracts claims, SETs PostgreSQL session variables
        → RLS policy: WHERE account_id = get_current_account_id()
          → Only this tenant's rows returned
```

## Lab Procedures

::alert[**This is the most involved step in the workshop — go slow, and don't rush the deploys.** Every step until now was "uncomment one fence, `make deploy`." This one has more moving parts, so it's organized into two halves. Do **Part A** fully (deploy + test) before starting **Part B**.

- **Part A — Tool access (who can call what):** add Cedar policies → deploy in log-only mode → switch to enforce → test (Steps 7.1, 7.6, 7.8).
- **Part B — Data isolation (who sees which rows):** flip the RLS switch → understand the interceptor → test cross-tenant isolation (Steps 7.2–7.5, 7.7).

The two halves are independent — Part A controls *which tools* a role can call; Part B controls *which rows* a query returns. You'll prove each one separately.]{type="info"}

### A 60-second primer on Cedar (read before 7.1)

You're about to write your first :link[Cedar]{href="https://www.cedarpolicy.com/"} policies, so here's the whole idea in a paragraph. **Cedar is a policy language** (the same engine behind Amazon Verified Permissions) that answers one question — *"is this principal allowed to do this action on this resource?"* — with **formal logic, not an LLM judgment call.** Three things to know and you can read every policy in this step:

- It is **default-deny**: if nothing explicitly `permit`s an action, it's denied.
- **`forbid` always beats `permit`.** So the usual pattern is one broad `permit` (allow everything) plus narrow `forbid`s that carve out exceptions. That's exactly what you'll deploy: *permit all tools, then forbid the booking tool for analysts and the Custom-SQL tools for staff.*
- A policy reads almost like English: `forbid(principal, action == "create_booking", resource) when { principal.getTag("custom:role") == "analyst" };` — "forbid the create-booking action when the caller's role is analyst."

Why not just tell the agent in the prompt "don't let analysts book"? Because a prompt is a *suggestion* an attacker can talk the model out of (prompt injection). Cedar is evaluated at the **Gateway, before the agent runs** — the analyst's session literally never sees the tool. That's the difference between application-level and infrastructure-level security, and it's the whole point of this step.

### Step 7.1: Add Cedar Policies (TODO 7.1) — *Part A: tool access*

::alert[**Complete Steps 4, 5, and 6 first.** Two of the Cedar policies guard tools from those steps — `ForbidWriteAnalystPolicy` depends on the Step-5 booking target and `ForbidCustomSqlStaffPolicy` on the Step-6 Custom SQL target. If you uncomment Step 7a before those targets exist, `make deploy` fails with `Unresolved resource dependencies [ApiIntegTarget]` (or `[CustomSqlTarget]`). Deploy the toolset steps in order, then return here.]{type="warning"}

:link[AgentCore Policy]{href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/policy.html"} uses :link[Cedar]{href="https://www.cedarpolicy.com/"}, a policy language created by AWS. Cedar policies are **deterministic** — unlike prompt-based restrictions, they use formal logic for safeguarding against prompt injection.

Open :code[/workshop/agentic-analytics/app/agentcore_strands/agentcore-topup-stack.yaml]{showCopyAction=true}. **Step 7a has TWO fences you must uncomment** — both are labelled `Step 7a`:

1. The **Policy Engine + Cedar policies** block (the `PolicyEngine` resource and the three `AWS::BedrockAgentCore::Policy` resources).
2. The **3-line `PolicyEngineConfiguration` block on the Gateway** (this wires the Gateway to the policy engine — they must come live together, or the Gateway would reference a policy engine that doesn't exist).

::alert[**Tip — uncomment each block at once.** Don't delete each `#` by hand, especially for the larger policy-engine block. The Code Editor is VS Code: click the first line *inside* a fence, then **Shift+click** the last line inside it to select the block, and press **Cmd + /** (macOS) or **Ctrl + /** (Windows/Linux) to toggle the comments off for every selected line in one go. Do this for **both** Step-7a fences. Select only the lines **between** the markers — not the marker lines themselves.]{type="info"}

::::expand{header="💡 Need help with TODO 7.1? Click to see exactly what to uncomment"}
Uncomment **both** Step-7a fences:
- The `# ===== UNCOMMENT FROM HERE (Step 7a: Cedar policy engine ...)` fence — the `PolicyEngine`, `AllowAllToolsPolicy`, `ForbidWriteAnalystPolicy`, and `ForbidCustomSqlStaffPolicy` resources.
- The small `# --- Step 7a: ALSO uncomment these 3 lines ...` block on the `Gateway` resource — the `PolicyEngineConfiguration:` / `Arn:` / `Mode:` lines.

If you uncomment only the policies but not the Gateway block, the policies exist but aren't enforced. If you uncomment only the Gateway block but not the policies, `make deploy` fails because the Gateway references a `PolicyEngine` that isn't there. Uncomment both.
::::

Then deploy — first in LOG_ONLY mode (the default), which logs policy decisions without blocking:

```bash
cd /workshop/agentic-analytics/app/agentcore_strands
make deploy
```

Once that succeeds, switch to **enforcement** by redeploying with the policy mode flipped:

```bash
make deploy POLICY_MODE=ENFORCE
```

The three policies (already written in the template) are:

```cedar
// 1. Base permit — allow all tools for any authenticated principal
permit(principal, action, resource == AgentCore::Gateway::"<arn>");

// 2. Forbid booking tool for analysts
forbid(principal is AgentCore::OAuthUser,
  action == AgentCore::Action::"APIInteg___create_booking_tool",
  resource == AgentCore::Gateway::"<arn>")
when { principal.getTag("custom:role") == "analyst" };

// 3. Forbid Custom SQL for staff (too risky for non-technical users)
forbid(principal is AgentCore::OAuthUser,
  action in [AgentCore::Action::"CustomSQL___text_to_sql_tool",
             AgentCore::Action::"CustomSQL___execute_sql_tool"],
  resource == AgentCore::Gateway::"<arn>")
when { principal.getTag("custom:role") == "staff" };
```

::alert[**`make deploy POLICY_MODE=ENFORCE`** passes `PolicyMode=ENFORCE` to the stack — the same `PolicyMode` parameter the Gateway's `PolicyEngineConfiguration.Mode` reads. LOG_ONLY logs decisions but allows every call (useful for testing); ENFORCE blocks unauthorized calls at the Gateway.]{type="info"}

::alert[**Forbid wins over permit.** Cedar uses default-deny with forbid-wins semantics. The base permit allows everything, then forbid policies carve out exceptions. If any forbid matches, access is denied — regardless of permits. This is the :link[recommended pattern]{href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/example-policies.html"} for AgentCore Policy.]{type="info"}

### Step 7.2: Switch to the RLS-Enforced Database Role (TODO 7.2)

Currently, your Lambda tools connect to the database as `postgres` — the table owner. In PostgreSQL, **table owners bypass Row-Level Security by default**. This means RLS policies have no effect, and all tenants' data is visible.

To fix this, you'll switch to `app_user` — a non-owner role created during the base CloudFormation deployment. Because `app_user` doesn't own the tables, PostgreSQL automatically enforces RLS on every query.

#### TODO 7.2: Flip the RLS feature flag (no redeploy)

The three SQL Lambdas are already wired with **both** database secrets — the `postgres` owner and the `app_user` non-owner — and they decide which to use at **runtime** by reading a feature flag in :link[AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store]{href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html"}. The flag (`/agentic-analytics/rls-mode`) currently reads `disabled`, so they connect as `postgres` and RLS is bypassed. Flip it to `enabled` and they connect as `app_user` — **no `make deploy`**.

Flip it from the Code Editor terminal:

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter --name /agentic-analytics/rls-mode \
  --value enabled --type String --overwrite --region us-east-1
```

(Or use the console: **Systems Manager → Parameter Store → `/agentic-analytics/rls-mode` → Edit → `enabled`**.)

The Lambdas cache the flag for up to ~60 seconds, so give it a moment (or click the chat's bin icon to start a fresh conversation) before testing.

::alert[**Why a runtime flag instead of a redeploy?** Both secrets are attached to each Lambda; the SSM flag picks one per request (cached briefly). Flipping RLS changes **no** infrastructure — no `make deploy`, no new Lambda version — so the change is near-instant and the provisioned-concurrency alias keeps serving warm. This is also closer to how you'd gate a security mode in production: a feature flag you can flip (and audit) without a deployment. In production you'd graduate this to :link[AWS AppConfig]{href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html"} for staged rollout and automatic rollback.]{type="info"}

::alert[**Fail-closed.** If the Lambda can't read the flag, it defaults to RLS **enforced** (app_user) — it errs toward over-restricting rather than leaking another tenant's rows.]{type="warning"}

### Step 7.3: Understand RLS Session Variables

The Lambda tools SET PostgreSQL session variables from the JWT claims before executing queries. The RLS policies use these variables to filter rows:

```sql
-- RLS policy on the customers table (already in the schema):
CREATE POLICY tenant_read_customers ON customers
  FOR SELECT USING (account_id = get_current_account_id());
-- get_current_account_id() reads the session variable SET by the Lambda
```

Open :code[tools/prebaked_sql_toolset_lambda.py]{showCopyAction=true} and look at `get_db_connection`:

```python
def get_db_connection(rls_context=None):
    ...
    if rls_context and (rls_context.get('account_id') or rls_context.get('role')):
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            if rls_context.get('account_id'):
                cur.execute("SET app.current_account_id = %s", [rls_context['account_id']])
            if rls_context.get('role'):
                cur.execute("SET app.current_user_role = %s", [rls_context['role']])
    return conn
```

This pattern is the same in all three Lambda toolsets. The `rls_context` is extracted from the JWT by `lambda_handler` and passed through the call chain. When the Lambda connects as `app_user` (after the credential switch in Step 7.2), PostgreSQL RLS policies read these session variables to filter rows by tenant.

### Step 7.4: Examine the Gateway Interceptor

The Lambda tools now know how to SET session variables from JWT claims — but the JWT needs to reach the Lambda first. By default, the Gateway authenticates the request but does **not** forward the Authorization header to Lambda targets.

The :link[Gateway Interceptor]{href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-headers.html"} solves this. It's already part of your stack's baseline — the `InterceptorLambda` and the Gateway's `InterceptorConfigurations` came live with the very first `make deploy` in Step 2. It's a Lambda function that runs on every Gateway request and injects headers into the target call. The `Authorization` header from the interceptor response is :link[automatically propagated to the target]{href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-headers.html#gateway-headers-interceptor-propagation"}.

Open :code[infra/interceptor_lambda.py]{showCopyAction=true} and look at the key section:

```python
# Extract Authorization header (case-insensitive)
auth_header = None
for key, value in headers.items():
    if key.lower() == 'authorization':
        auth_header = value
        break

# Propagate to Lambda targets
response_headers = {}
if auth_header:
    response_headers['Authorization'] = auth_header
```

This is the bridge between the Gateway (which validates the JWT) and the Lambda (which reads the JWT claims for RLS). Without it, `_extract_rls_context_from_jwt()` in the Lambda would receive no headers and RLS would have no tenant or user's role context.

### Step 7.5: One flag controls all three Lambdas

There are **no separate scripts to re-run and no redeploy.** All three SQL Lambdas read the same `/agentic-analytics/rls-mode` flag you flipped in Step 7.2, so `DataFoundationLambda`, `ApiIntegLambda`, and `CustomSqlLambda` all switch to the `app_user` secret together — within ~60 seconds of the flip (the cache window). Confirm the flag value:

```bash
aws ssm get-parameter --name /agentic-analytics/rls-mode --query Parameter.Value --output text --region us-east-1
# expect: enabled
```

Cedar enforcement (Step 7.1, deployed) and the RLS switch (Step 7.2, the runtime flag) are both live now.

### Step 7.6: Test Tool-Level Access Control

All test users share the same password: :code[Unicorn123!]{showCopyAction=true}

| User | Role | Tenant |
|------|------|--------|
| :code[lyra.starwhisper@example-mythicalunicorns.com]{showCopyAction=true} | rental_admin | Mythical Unicorns |
| :code[orion.moonshadow@example-mythicalunicorns.com]{showCopyAction=true} | analyst | Mythical Unicorns |
| :code[aria.skybloom@example-mythicunicorns.com]{showCopyAction=true} | rental_admin | Mythic Unicorns |

::alert[**Start fresh:** It is best to clear the chatbot conversation from the previous step by clicking the small bin icon next to the chat input field or by refreshing the application demo browser tab.]{type="info"}

**Test as Admin (Lyra):**

1. Log in as Lyra, ask: **"Show me top 5 customers by revenue"**
2. You should see customers.
3. Ask: **"Create a booking for my top customer next Sunday 2:30 pm for 30 mins with unicorn Vega Sapphire"** — it should work

**Test as Analyst (Orion):**

4. Log out, log in as Orion
5. Ask: **"Show me top 5 customers by revenue"** — same query, same tenant data
6. Ask: **"Create a booking for my top customer next Sunday 2:30 pm for 30 mins with unicorn Vega Sapphire"** — the agent cannot do this. The `create_booking_tool` is **inaccessible** for the analyst.

### Step 7.7: Test Tenant Data Isolation — *Part B payoff*

This is the most important test in the workshop. Log in as users from **different tenants** and confirm they see different data from the *same* question.

**As Mythical Unicorns (Lyra):**

1. Ask: **"Show me my top 3 customers by revenue"** — **write down the #1 customer's name.**

**As Mythic Unicorns (Aria):**

2. Log out, log in as :code[aria.skybloom@example-mythicunicorns.com]{showCopyAction=true}
3. Ask the **exact same question** — **write down her #1 customer's name.**

::alert[**What you should see — and why it's the whole point.** Lyra's and Aria's number 1 customers are **different names** (e.g. Lyra's top customer is an organization; Aria's is a different individual entirely). Same agent, same Gateway, same Lambda, same SQL — but each tenant got only **their own rows**. *That difference is RLS working.* Before you flipped the flag, both users would have seen the **same** global list (the Lambda was connecting as the table owner, which bypasses RLS). Now the database engine itself filters by `account_id` from the JWT — isolation no application bug can undo. Even if the LLM wrote a Custom-SQL query with no tenant filter, RLS still protects the data. **If both users see the same names,** RLS isn't active yet: confirm `/agentic-analytics/rls-mode` reads `enabled` (Step 7.2), and wait out the ~60s flag cache (or start a fresh chat) before retrying.]{type="success"}

### Step 7.8: The Invisibility Test — *Part A payoff*

The Cedar policy doesn't just *refuse* the booking tool — it makes it **invisible**.

1. Log in as **Orion (analyst)**, ask: **"List every tool you can use."**
2. Log in as **Lyra (admin)**, ask the **same** question.

::alert[**What you should see.** Orion's list contains only *read* booking tools (e.g. `get_bookings`, `get_booking_summary`) — there is **no create-booking tool**. Lyra's list **includes `APIInteg___create_booking_tool`.** Same agent, same Gateway; the only difference is the `custom:role` claim in their JWT, and Cedar uses it to hide the write tool from the analyst *at the Gateway, before the agent runs.* A prompt restriction ("don't let analysts create bookings") can be talked around with prompt injection; this cannot — **the agent can't call what it can't see.** That's why this belongs at the infrastructure layer, not in the prompt.]{type="info"}

## Verification

- After uncommenting both Step-7a fences and `make deploy`, the stack has a Policy Engine with 3 Cedar policies
- `make deploy POLICY_MODE=ENFORCE` switches the Gateway to enforcement mode
- Flipping `/agentic-analytics/rls-mode` to `enabled` switches all three SQL Lambdas to the `app_user` secret (within ~60s, no redeploy)
- Admin (Lyra) can create bookings; analyst (Orion) cannot see the tool
- Mythical Unicorns user sees only Mythical Unicorns data
- Mythic Unicorns user sees only Mythic Unicorns data

## Troubleshooting

**Still seeing all tenants' data**
- Did you set `/agentic-analytics/rls-mode` to `enabled` (Step 7.2)? Check: `aws ssm get-parameter --name /agentic-analytics/rls-mode --query Parameter.Value --output text`.
- The Lambdas cache the flag ~60s — wait it out, or start a fresh chat (bin icon), then retry.
- The Gateway Interceptor must be live — it's in the Step-2 baseline, so confirm the stack deployed cleanly back then.

**Analyst can still create bookings**
- Verify you ran `make deploy POLICY_MODE=ENFORCE` (not just `make deploy`, which defaults to LOG_ONLY).
- The user must log in via the Cognito Hosted UI (click Login button). Direct API auth doesn't carry OAuth claims.

**Queries return zero results**
- The interceptor must be deployed for JWT propagation. Without it, the Lambda has no JWT context and RLS blocks all rows (fail-closed).
- Check that you're logged in (not Guest mode).
